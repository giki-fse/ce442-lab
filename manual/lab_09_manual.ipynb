    "### Matrix Inversion Method for Solving Linear Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "The matrix inversion method is a direct way of solving a linear system $Ax = b$. The idea is to compute the inverse of the matrix $A$ (if it exists), and then multiply it by the vector $b$ to find the solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x = A^{-1}b\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $A$ is the square matrix of coefficients.\n",
    "- $x$ is the vector of unknowns.\n",
    "- $b$ is the vector of constants.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps Involved\n",
    "1. **Calculate the Inverse of $A$**: The inverse of a matrix $A$, denoted as $A^{-1}$, is a matrix such that when multiplied by $A$, it gives the identity matrix $I$:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   A^{-1}A = I\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Multiply the Inverse by $b$**: After computing $A^{-1}$, the solution $x$ can be obtained by multiplying it with the vector $b$:\n",

    "   x = A^{-1}b\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Considerations\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: Computing the inverse of a matrix is computationally expensive and less efficient than other methods like LU decomposition or Gaussian elimination, especially for large matrices.\n",
    "- **Numerical Stability**: Inverting a matrix can lead to numerical errors if the matrix is ill-conditioned (i.e., if it is close to being singular).\n",
    "- **Existence of Inverse**: The matrix $A$ must be square (same number of rows and columns) and non-singular (its determinant must be non-zero) for the inverse to exist."
